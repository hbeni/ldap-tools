ldap-preg_replace.pl CHANGELOG
------------------------------

Version 1.1.2 (2015-11-05):
* Removed warnings for keys on scalar

Version 1.1.1 (2015-05-20):
* Implemented cleander disconnect from LDAP

Version 1.1 (2015-03-28):
* Convinience release: password asking is now done after
   verifying parameters

Version 1.0 (2014-11-28):
This version brings to you new features, performance improvements and clearer
code. One of the main changes is a new command line invocation regarding -a and
-r parameters because now several rules are supported. This means that options
-a/-A were dropped (the program will complain if you still try touse them!) and
several invocations of -r are possible. Also the syntax of -r has changed!
See the README.txt and use parameter -h for details.
The complete changelist is as following:
* New syntax for -r parameter:
  - several invocations allowed
  - -a/-A were dropped as the attribute is now specified in -r
  - new, more simple behavior for application of regex,
    most important with ^ and &, as well as patterns like /.*/; those patterns
    behave a little differently now and will match alwas on an additional
    empty-string-value for each attribute (like using -A in prior versions)
* Enhanced documentation (both in codebase and in help messages)
* New debug options: -v can be given several times now, yielding more messages
* New -l (--ldif) parameter which results in a LDIF-change file being written.
  This is especially useful with option -d if you just want to generate a
  changefile but don't want the changes be applied instantly (revising, etc)
* New --ask parameter to allow you to explicitely confirm each entry change
* New -t (--timelimit) and -s (--sizelimit) parameters to request such
  limits from the LDAP server; -s my be useful with -d to testing your patterns
* New -P (--pagesize) parameter to support and control LDAP simplePaging,
  please note that paging is enabled by default. Use '-P 0' to disable paging.
* Support for LDAP-URLs in -H, including setting baseDN, scope and filter
* All options have long paramter equivalents now


Version 0.9.6 (2013-08-12):
* Cosmetic fix: printing of newline after manually entering password


Version 0.9.5 (2013-03-13):
* Security release:
   - Obscuring of process name (hiding password from commandline)
   - If -p is omitted, the program will ask for it (if not run
     interactively, it will read it from STDIN)
* New -S parameter for scoping


Version 0.9.4-1 (2009-04-24)
* Updated README to better describe attribute adding


Version 0.9.4 (2009-04-23)
* New -A parameter
* Added description of -A to README
* Slightly changed default behavior:
  - providing -a now only operates on present values like in 0.9.2
  - providing an empty pattern (s/^$/...) must be used now to indicate value addition
    if emtpys attribute is not set
  - -A together with an empty pattern indicates that value addition should also occur
    if the entries attribute already contains values
* Some comment changes


Version 0.9.3-1 (2009-03-04)
* Forgot to add -F parameter to GetOpt, so -F was not accessible in 0.9.3
* Added description of -F and filtertuning to README file


Version 0.9.3 (2009-03-03):
* It is now possible to add values to empty attributes by specifying a empty from-regex,
  e.g. s/^$/foo/ will add "foo" to empty attributes (s//foo/ will prepend etc)
* Filtertuning is dependent on the regex now; if one of the combinations
  s// (will trigger a warning), s/^/, s/$/ or s/^$/ is used, the filter is used as-is. In other cases, the
  specified filter will, as already implemented, be embedded in "(&($yourattr=*)$yourfilter)", so the search
  will only consider entries with values in the attribute which will improve
  search speed significantly (especially at large searches!). Since this is not only
  correct (for example if you use alternative regex-delimeters), -F was introduced
  to override that behaviour (see below).
* Added new parameter -F to enable the user to bypass search performance tuning
  Details are described in the advanced help page (-h)
* Some minor comment changes (added some and translated the german ones into english)


Version 0.9.2 (2008-12-10):
* Changed parameter behavior:
  - -H is optional now and defaults to 'localhost'
  - -p can be empty now by specifying '-p ""'

Version 0.9.1 (2008-08-04):
* Just some comment changes and additional help.
  The codebase was not changed and is equal to 0.9.

Version 0.9 (2008-07-24):
 * initial release
