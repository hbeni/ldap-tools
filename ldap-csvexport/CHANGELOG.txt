ldap-csvexport.pl CHANGELOG
------------------------------

Version 1.10 (2024-05-22):
* Added new [format=...] flag to option -a in order to format GeneralizedTime attribute values

Version 1.9 (2016-05-23):
* Added fixed width option to attribute flags (global option: -w)

Version 1.8 (2015-12-01):
* Bugfix in debug output (chain-reference found value was not printed)
* New support for \n and friends in -m, -s and -q options (beware shell escaping!).

Version 1.7.3 (2015-05-20):
* Implemented cleaner disconnect from LDAP

Version 1.7.2 (2015-03-31):
* Ficed a bug with -a fix=... syntax wrongly not being supported anymore

Version 1.7.1 (2015-03-28):
* Convinience release: password asking is now done after
  verifying parameters

Version 1.7 (2015-03-12)
* New attribute flag: `-a [#]attribute` prints number of values instead of
  contents. This is useful if one wants to know how many values are present.
  The flag implicitely turns on multivalue-mode for the attribute and
  is compatible with attribute chains (like `manager.[#]mail`).
* Option -H now supports LDAP URLs with all query options, so it is
  more convinient to call the program (overriding cmdline options):
  format: ldap[s]://<hostname>:<port>/<base_dn>?<attributes>?<scope>?<filter>

Version 1.6.1 (2015-01-31):
* New switch -x to disable schema checks
* Fixed a bug (SF Bug #6) with schema checking; program failed when schema was
  not accessible. Now it can continue with schema checks diabled.
* Some little more documentation

Version 1.6 (2015-01-09):
 * Added support for attribute flags: '[sv]mail' now will select
   only the first value if overall operation is mv-export (default),
   whereas '[mv]mail' will export multivalued when parameter -1 is
   in effect.
 * Added consistent behaviour when performing chained requests;
   now in default mode all reference links will be evaluated.
   Use the new flag feature in case you want to change this,
   eg '[sv]manager.mail' in case you only want the first manager
   but all mail adresses of this manager ('[sv]manager.[sv]mail'
   in case only the first mail of the first manager).
 * Reimplemented performance for queries; in 1.4 and 1.5 all attributes
   where requested resulting in more load on the server side and more
   network bandwith used. 1.6 now only requests the needed attributes.

Version 1.5 (2014-12-17):
 * Added support for filtering entries by regexp matching on DN.
   If parameter -F is given (eg '/pattern/'; options like /.../i
   are supported!), entries whose DN is matching this regexp will
   be skipped. This may be handy eg. to exclude certain subtrees.

Version 1.4 (2014-12-16):
 * Added support for chained requests (eg. -a 'manager.sn')
 * Added support for timelimit (-T) and sizelimit (-c)

Version 1.3.6 (2013-11-28):
 * New -C parameter switch to disable CSV header output

Version 1.3.5 (2013-08-12):
 * Cosmetic fix: printing of newline after manually entering password

Version 1.3.4 (2013-03-13):
 * Security release:
   - Obscuring of process name (hiding password from commandline)
   - If -p is omitted, the program will ask for it (if not run
     interactively, it will read it from STDIN)

Version 1.3.3 (2013-02-26):
 * Sort option is now optional and disabled by default.
 * Sorting of unrequested search attributes is now supported (if by server, too)
 * New feature to print fixed strings in columns
 * Changed escaping of -a: Now escaping is optional and MUST be performed
   if attribute flavors are to be selected! (until 1.3.2 semicolon was used
   automatically for flavors)

Version 1.3.2 (2012-11-09):
 * Bugfix for paging: the last page was not processed correctly.

Version 1.3.1 (2012-07-02):
 * Support for timeouts
 * New feature to be able to extract DNs, RDNs and parent DNs

Version 1.2.1 (2011-09-15):
 * Bugfix for paging support (fixes sf-tracker-id #3389040)

Version 1.2 (2011-04-05):
 * New support for paging (parameter -l), thanks to FrenkX
 * New -S parameter to select the scope of the LDAP search

Version 1.1 (2011-03-08):
 * Bugfix for -a parameter (Paramter-change!):
   The semicolon MUST be escaped to be used as attribute selection separator, because LDAP allows "attribute flavors":
      -a 'sn,givenName,description;lang-en'  => sn, givenName, description;lang-en
      -a 'sn,givenName,description\;lang-en' => sn, givenName, description, lang-en
   This changes behavior of the -a parameter compared to 1.0, so please check your scripts. If you did rely on this,
   you will select one attribute because the list won't got split anymore.
 * Bugfix for empty csv fields: now they get properly enclosed in quote chars (parameter -q).

Version 1.0 (2008-12-10 10:00):
 * initial public release
